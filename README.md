**Lightning-fast Sudoku solving and generation, crafted in Rust.**

Rustoku is a highly optimized Sudoku puzzle solver and generator built with a focus on speed and clarity.
It leverages [bitmasking] for constraint tracking and a backtracking algorithm with [MRV] for
puzzle navigation. Available as a Rust library and command-line tool.

- **Fast solving with clear solve paths:** Rustoku can find solutions in microseconds, even
for the most complex puzzles. Plus, it shows you the step-by-step solve path for understanding
how the solution was reached
- **Unique and configurable puzzle generation:** Create Sudoku puzzles that are guaranteed to
have only one solution. You can also customize the difficulty by generating puzzles with a
specific number of clues
- **Human-like puzzle solving:** Take control with Rustoku's CLI interface. Beyond raw speed, it
mimics human expertise, employing a full range of techniques from [Naked Singles] to [X-Wing]
to solve puzzles with precision
